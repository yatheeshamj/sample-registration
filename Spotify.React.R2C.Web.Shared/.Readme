This library is to be shared between the portal widget and the R2C Web app.

Please note; Do not use router logic inside this library, at all!!
Since the portal widget doesnt use urls/Router logic.

So no chaning routes, urls etc...

If we need to handle a on click event that does a router changein the R2C web app pass it in via props
that way you can pass it in via props for the Portal Widget and you handle it from the parent
